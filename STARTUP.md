# Startup Checklist — Sharealedger Conceptual Model

Read this at the start of every working session before doing anything else.

---

## Every session

1. **Read [`README.md`](README.md)** — repo structure and what lives where
2. **Read [`work-log.md`](work-log.md)** — what has been done, what is open at the
   repo level, confidentiality notes

## If working on a specific project

3. **Read `projects/<name>/README.md`** — what the project is and its current state
4. **Read `projects/<name>/todo.md`** — active task list; check HIGH items first
5. **Read `projects/<name>/log.md`** — what was done last session and the current
   state of the project

## Active projects

| Project | README | Todo | Log |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hospice App | [`projects/hospiceapp/README.md`](projects/hospiceapp/README.md) | [`todo.md`](projects/hospiceapp/todo.md) | [`log.md`](projects/hospiceapp/log.md) |
| Ledger Lab | [`projects/ledger-lab/README.md`](projects/ledger-lab/README.md) | [`todo.md`](projects/ledger-lab/todo.md) | [`log.md`](projects/ledger-lab/log.md) |

## Confidentiality rule

Do not use specific institution names in this public repo. Use generic descriptions:
- "global financial institution" or "major global bank"
- "major U.S. insurer"
- "major U.S. agency" for VA / government context

See `work-log.md` for the full confidentiality notes and history of fixes.
